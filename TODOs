search:
- sort results into "Reference" and "Book" categories
- avoid `null` titles (figure out what went wrong and fix it)
- auto-append `*` to incremental search (unless the user hit `Delete`)
- update pre-computed index as part of all GitHub workflows

book:
- build all the non-English versions
- record SHA and avoid re-building
- implement scheduled GitHub workflow to update automatically

manual pages:
- record mapping of version <-> SHA of contents
- implement scheduled GitHub workflow to update automatically

downloads:
- add a scheduled GitHub workflow to update automatically
- sidebar should not show "This book is available in ..."

general QA:
- compare sidebars between Rails App and Jekyll page
- ensure that current URLs would work after migration
