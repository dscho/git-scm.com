<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding
the objects contained within and writing them into the repository in
"loose" (one object per file) format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects that already exist in the repository will <strong>not</strong> be unpacked
from the packfile.  Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
this command on a packfile that exists within the target repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-repack" >}}'>git-repack[1]</a> for options to generate
new packs and replace existing ones.</p>

<p>When unpacking a corrupt packfile, the command dies at
the first corruption.  This flag tells it to keep going

possible.</p>
