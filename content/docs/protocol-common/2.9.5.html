<pre>  HEXDIG    =  DIGIT / "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"</pre>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  NUL       =  %x00

  refname /=  "refs/" &lt;see discussion below&gt;</pre>

<p>A refname is a hierarchical octet string beginning with "refs/" and

<p>They can include slash <code>/</code> for hierarchical (directory)
grouping, but no slash-separated component can begin with a

<li>
<p>They must contain at least one <code>/</code>. This enforces the presence of a
category like <code>heads/</code>, <code>tags/</code> etc. but the actual names are not
restricted.</p>

<li>
<p>They cannot have two consecutive dots <code>..</code> anywhere.</p>

<p>Much (but not all) of the payload is described around pkt-lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pkt-line is a variable length binary string.  The first four bytes
of the line, the pkt-len, indicates the total length of the line,
in hexadecimal.  The pkt-len includes the 4 bytes used to contain
the length&#8217;s hexadecimal representation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pkt-line MAY contain binary data, so implementors MUST ensure
pkt-line parsing/formatting routines are 8-bit clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A non-binary line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF, which if present
MUST be included in the total length. Receivers MUST treat pkt-lines
with non-binary data the same whether or not they contain the trailing
LF (stripping the LF if present, and not complaining when it is
missing).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The maximum length of a pkt-line&#8217;s data component is 65516 bytes.
Implementations MUST NOT send pkt-line whose length exceeds 65520
(65516 bytes of payload + 4 bytes of length data).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementations SHOULD NOT send an empty pkt-line ("0004").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A pkt-line with a length field of 0 ("0000"), called a flush-pkt,
