<p>Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The index must be in a fully merged state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conceptually, <em>git write-tree</em> sync()s the current index contents
into a set of tree files.
In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right
now, you need to have done a <em>git update-index</em> phase before you did the
<em>git write-tree</em>.</p>

<p>Normally <em>git write-tree</em> ensures that the objects referenced by the
directory exist in the object database.  This option disables this
check.</p>

<p>Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory

for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.</p>
